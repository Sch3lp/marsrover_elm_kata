Princess is all set up to be in a family way; she’s got her very own nest, it’s feathered, and she sits on it 23 and half hours a day. Golf balls, rocks, other chickens – if she can sit on it and it sort of fits under her, then it’s her baby. Princess is a natural leader when it comes to socializing in the flock, and you can always count on her to call the other girls over to a tasty treat. Are you also longing to hear the pitter patter of little talons in the coop? Do you also looooove tomatoes? Then swipe right on Princess, roosters and hentlemen. Serious inquiries only! Princess has got no time for head games, no siree."

That’s hardcore! Because she’s so tiny and round as a meatball, Baby Chicken has got that whole ‘I’m so little and cute’ thing going on. But don’t let that fool you. You see that evil glint in her eye? You might mistake it for RBF – Resting Bok Face, but it’s really just the cruel indifference of nature packaged into a chirping fluffball. That’s right. Baby Chicken would peck the eyeballs out of your skull if she liked the way it felt. Don’t wait; set up your date with Baby today!"
